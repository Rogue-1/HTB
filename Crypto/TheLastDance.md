### Challenge: TheLastDance

### Type: Crypto

### Tools: Cyberchef

We have 2 files. A python script and the output file from the script. The script tells us that it is being encrypted with ChaCha20 aka a stream cipher and the final lines of the script quickly tell us what each part of the output file is.


```python
from Crypto.Cipher import ChaCha20
from secret import FLAG
import os


def encryptMessage(message, key, nonce):
    cipher = ChaCha20.new(key=key, nonce=iv)
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(message)
    return ciphertext


def writeData(data):
    with open("out.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    message = b"Our counter agencies have intercepted your messages and a lot "
    message += b"of your agent's identities have been exposed. In a matter of "
    message += b"days all of them will be captured"

    key, iv = os.urandom(32), os.urandom(12)

    encrypted_message = encryptMessage(message, key, iv)
    encrypted_flag = encryptMessage(FLAG, key, iv)

    data = iv.hex() + "\n" + encrypted_message.hex() + "\n" + encrypted_flag.hex()
    writeData(data)
```

```

```iv.hex(c4a66edfe80227b4fa24d431)```

```encrypted_message.hex(7aa34395a258f5893e3db1822139b8c1f04cfab9d757b9b9cca57e1df33d093f07c7f06e06bb6293676f9060a838ea138b6bc9f20b08afeb73120506e2ce7b9b9dcd9e4a421584cfaba2481132dfbdf4216e98e3facec9ba199ca3a97641e9ca9782868d0222a1d7c0d3119b867edaf2e72e2a6f7d344df39a14edc39cb6f960944ddac2aaef324827c36cba67dcb76b22119b43881a3f1262752990)```


```encrypted_flag.hex(7d8273ceb459e4d4386df4e32e1aecc1aa7aaafda50cb982f6c62623cf6b29693d86b15457aa76ac7e2eef6cf814ae3a8d39c7)```

With this information we just need to understand how the outfile is being encrypted by ChaCha20.

So towards the bottom we see that the  ```encrypted_message = encryptMessage(message, key, iv)``` and ```encrypted_flag = encryptMessage(FLAG, key, iv)```

Simply put our encrypted message is being xored by the message itself and then the encrypted flag is being xored by the encrypted message.

Since I am not very good at making my own python scripts I ran this through Cyber Chef pretty quickly.

With that we have our flag and my 1st completion of a crypto challenge!
