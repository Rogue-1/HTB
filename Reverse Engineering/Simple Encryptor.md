### Challenge: Reverse Engineering

### Tools: Ghidra, Cyberchef, C

### Files: encrypt, flag.enc

### Description:On our regular checkups of our secret flag storage server we found out that we were hit by ransomware! The original flag data is nowhere to be found, but luckily we not only have the encrypted file but also the encryption program itself.

For starters I did not solve this challenge without a lot of help from some good people, this write up will be more for learning and record keeping.

This challenge is listed as very easy but for me it was harder than most that I have completed.



In Ghidra we have the main function that reads from a flag file and then encrypts each byte twice. 1st by Xoring and 2nd by ROL(Rotating Left). For a long time I read it as Rotating right and bit shifting right but neither of those options were getting me anywhere. After that it gets written to a file. On line 56

```cs
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  time_t tVar2;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  uint local_40;
  uint local_3c;
  long local_38;
  FILE *local_30;
  size_t local_28;
  void *local_20;
  FILE *local_18;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_30 = fopen("flag","rb");
  fseek(local_30,0,2);
  local_28 = ftell(local_30);
  fseek(local_30,0,0);
  local_20 = malloc(local_28);
  fread(local_20,local_28,1,local_30);
  fclose(local_30);
  tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  local_40 = (uint)tVar2;
  srand(local_40);
  for (local_38 = 0; local_38 < (long)local_28; local_38 = local_38 + 1) {
    iVar1 = rand();
    *(byte *)((long)local_20 + local_38) = *(byte *)((long)local_20 + local_38) ^ (byte)iVar1;
    local_3c = rand();
    local_3c = local_3c & 7;
    *(byte *)((long)local_20 + local_38) =
         *(byte *)((long)local_20 + local_38) << (sbyte)local_3c |
         *(byte *)((long)local_20 + local_38) >> 8 - (sbyte)local_3c;
  }
  local_18 = fopen("flag.enc","wb");
  fwrite(&local_40,1,4,local_18);
  fwrite(local_20,1,local_28,local_18);
  fclose(local_18);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
